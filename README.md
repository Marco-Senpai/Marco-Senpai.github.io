# Putting the **G** in Growth Mindset #

## _Defining the Terms_ ##

The growth mindset is essentially the idea or school of thought that
learning is the route to growth and development. Talent is simply a good
headstart when pursuing an endeavor or skill. The hard work is neede to refine 
the talent into a hardened skill to mold an expert. A growth mindset 
is the antithesis of a growth mindset. the fixed mindset stands at odds with the 
growth mindset. The fixed mindset sees a challenge and retreats. When the fixed mindset meets adversity it avoids it at every turn as shown in the image 
below:

## _Reminders_ ##

There are three ways I can keep myself in a growth mindset:
1. The first is to view challenges and disfficulty as an opportunity to 
become better than I am now.
2. Another way I can acheive a growth mindset more often is to view 
complacency as the silent killer of goals. 
3. Finally I can remain in a growth mindset through acknowledging 
when I need help or don't know something.
